			<h2>Gary Gannaway</h2>
			<span>CEO and Chairman of the Board</span>
			<p>Gary Gannaway is the founder and chief executive of WorldNow. Launched in 1998, WorldNow has become the leading provider of Web publishing, streaming video and strategic advertising solutions for over 400 local media Web sites with over 34M monthly unique visitors. WorldNow's clientele includes major media powerhouses, including Allbritton, Block Communications, Citadel, Cowles, CBS Local Digital Media, Cox, Davis TV, Delmarva, Dispatch, Draper, Drewry, Duhamel, Fisher, Gilmore Broadcasting, Global Broadcasting, Gormally, Grant, Griffin, Hoak Media, Landmark, Lilly, Lockwood, London, Max Media, McKinnon, Meredith, Midwest TV, Mt. Mansfield, Morgan Murphy, New Age Media, Pappas, Quincy, Raycom Media, Saga Communications, Sagamore Hill, Sarkes Tarzian, Smith Broadcasting, Titan, United Communications, Vindicator, West Virigina Media, Waterman and Young.</p><br/>

			<p>As the founder and CEO of Genesis Entertainment, Gannaway oversaw the distribution of such hit TV shows as Michael Landon's "Highway to Heaven", "Tales from the Crypt", "The Best of National Geographic" and "The Whoopi Goldberg Show."  He founded Genesis before he was 30 and sold it to Ron Perelman before he was 40. Perelman went on to sell it to News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch for a sizable profit.</p><br/>

			<p>Throughout his career, Gary has demonstrated a unique ability to predict the landscape ahead. Gary developed trail-blazing advertising and sponsorship models, which have become industry best practices. His innovations attracted sponsors new to television. Looking at TV in a non-linear way, Gary offered advertising and sponsorship opportunities that incorporated non-TV platforms long before anyone else was doing so. Genesis is the only TV company in history to launch each of the 17 pilots it created.</p><br/>

			<p>In the 90's, Gary foresaw the consolidation in the TV syndication business as well as the potential influence of the Internet and boldly launched WorldNow after the sale of Genesis.</p> <br/> 

			<p>Gary was honored, over 432 eligible competitors, as the winner of the prestigious Entertainment Entrepreneur of the Year award from Merrill Lynch, Ernst & Young and INC Magazine. He sits on the board of the Department of Neurosurgery at John Hopkins University Medical Center and was chosen by Wharton to participate in its Entrepreneur-in-Residence program, mentoring undergraduates and MBA candidates who are considering careers as entrepreneurs. In addition, he is prominent speaker and panelist at top industry conferences and forums.</p>
